Configuration files that make me hate computers less

At the moment, these are created to set up a macOS machine the way I like it. In future, I will expand them to configure all my servers and machines the way I like them.

You can use [Bork](https://github.com/mattly/bork) to auto-install and configure these files. You can use the `compile_bork.sh` script to create a `bork.sh` file which will run on any machine, even those that do not have Bork installed.
